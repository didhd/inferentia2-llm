Tillerson had reportedly dismissed Trump in the past as a \"moron,\" while the President publicly hinted that he would win an IQ contest against his top diplomat. \n  \n Learning to deal with the President \n  \n In his conversation with Labott, Tillerson said that his relationship with Trump is evolving, and one that he's been learning to navigate during his first year on the job. \n  \n \"My relationship with him... is a developing one,\" Tillerson said, adding that he hadn't met Trump when he was asked to lead the State Department. \"So, we don't have a lot of history in past, so part of this is us knowing -- coming to learn and understand one another,\" he said. \n  \n While Trump repeatedly seemed to undermine Tillerson's diplomatic efforts in tweets, and White House sources regularly leaked stories damaging to the former ExxonMobil CEO, Tillerson said he \"learned over the past year better how to deal with the president.\" \n  \n JUST WATCHED WH won't say if Trump confident in Tillerson Replay More Videos... MUST WATCH WH won't say if Trump confident in Tillerson 03:34 \n  \n \"In terms of what I would do different, I'm going to build on my ability to communicate with the President better,\" Tillerson told Labott. \"I had to learn is what is effective with this President. He is not a typical of Presidents of the past. I think that's well recognized. That's also the why the American people chose him.\" \n  \n And despite reports that he would soon leave the administration -- either with the help of a hefty push from Trump or under his own steam -- Tillerson said he wasn't going anywhere. \n  \n Pressed on whether he'll be around to enjoy that success, Tillerson said, \"I intend to be here for the whole year.\" \n  \n Tillerson also pushed back against characterizations in the Wolff book that Trump lacks the attention span and focus to get through meetings with foreign leaders, sometimes leaving them early. \n  \n \"I have never seen the president leave a meeting with a foreign leader,\" Tillerson said, adding that \"among all the Cabinet secretaries, I probably have spent more time with the President than perhaps Secretary (of) Defense (James) Mattis, who spends a lot of time with him as well.\" \n  \n And in policy deliberations on tough issues ranging from North Korea to Afghanistan to South Asia policy in Pakistan to the ISIS campaign, the President \"has been very deliberative, he has listened to the arguments, he argues back as he should... and in the end, he makes a decision which we then implement,\" Tillerson said. \"I would tell you on all of the major policy areas, the President has made the right decision on every one of those.\" ||||| Add this Tweet to your website by copying the code below.

He added in a tweet: \"They should try winning an election. Sad!\" \n  \n Mr Tillerson - who is alleged to have called Mr Trump a moron last year - told CNN: \"I have no reason to question his mental fitness.\" \n  \n He said Mr Trump was \"not typical of presidents of the past\". \n  \n \"I think that's well recognised. That's also though why the American people chose him,\" he said. \n  \n On Saturday, Mr Trump will begin two days of talks with senior Republicans to discuss policy priorities for the coming year. \n  \n What are the questions on Trump's mental health? \n  \n In a television interview on Friday, Wolff said \"100% of the people\" around Mr Trump questioned his fitness for office. \n  \n His book alleges that Mr Trump failed to recognise close friends, and was prone to repeating comments. \n  \n Wolff said that White House staff described the president as childlike because \"he has the need for immediate gratification. It's all about him... This man does not read, does not listen. He's like a pinball just shooting off the sides.\" \n  \n The president said he had not given Wolff access to the White House nor spoken to him for the book. \n  \n But Wolff responded: \"What was I doing there if he didn't want me to be there? I absolutely spoke to the president... It was not off the record.\" \n  \n He said he had spent a total of three hours with Mr Trump, both during the election campaign and after the inauguration. \n  \n Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Wolff said staff had come to realise \"the emperor has no clothes\". \n  \n What else is in the book? \n  \n It cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Trump election campaign officials, including Mr Trump's son Donald Jr, as \"treasonous\". \n  \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dozens queued for the midnight release of Fire and Fury \n  \n Both Mr Trump Jr and his father deny that any collusion with Russians to win the election took place. However Mr Bannon is quoted in the book as saying: \"They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.\" \n  \n The meeting is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. \n  \n The book makes many other claims, including that: \n  \n The Trump team was shocked and horrified by his election win \n  \n His wife, Melania, was in tears of sadness on election night \n  \n His daughter, Ivanka, had a plan with her husband, Jared Kushner, that she would be \"the first woman president\" \n  \n Ivanka mocked her dad's \"comb-over\" hairstyle and \"often described the mechanics behind it to friends\" \n  \n The accuracy of some excerpts has been criticised and questioned in US media. \n  \n Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, says BBC North America editor Jon Sopel. \n  \n Will it actually hurt Trump? \n  \n Analysis: BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher \n  \n Donald Trump's supporters have seen many a media storm over the past few years, and somehow their man always emerges (relatively) unscathed. The book may be generating considerable heat among the chattering class, but there's little to indicate that its lasting impact will be much more than confirming long-held suspicions of Trump critics and re-enforcing the bunker mentality in the White House. \n  \n Outside Washington, in places where people don't devoutly follow every permutation of the presidential Twitter feed, the Trump administration is compiling a boast-worthy economic record. \n  \n Despite some doom-and-gloom predictions following the 2016 election, the stock market has soared. Unemployment remains low. Major corporations are making high-profile moves to at least temporarily boost their workers' paycheques. And the president can start pointing to his party's tax bill as a tangible reason why the economy is humming along. \n  \n If the current trajectory continues, Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans will be positioned to make the case to voters in the months and years ahead that despite all the drama - the often self-inflicted fire and fury - their agenda is to help Americans where it counts the most, in their pockets. \n  \n That's the kind of message that can win. \n  \n What will happen to Steve Bannon? \n  \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his \"worst enemies\" \n  \n Mr Trump said Mr Bannon - who was sacked in August - had \"lost his mind\" after losing his White House position, adding in a tweet that Mr Bannon had cried when he lost his job. \n  \n Reports suggest that more conservative factions in the Republican party are rallying around Mr Trump. \n  \n Billionaire conservative donor Rebekah Mercer, who had backed Mr Bannon financially and invested in the right-wing Breitbart news website that he heads, cut ties with the former strategist, and reiterated her support for the president. \n  \n What else is happening at the White House? \n  \n Despite the storm over the book, the Trump administration has been pressing ahead with its agenda. On Thursday it: \n  \n On Friday, Mr Trump refused to answer questions about the book as he departed for Camp David from the White House. Mr Trump will spend two days meeting top Republicans at the retreat to discuss his legislative priorities for the year ahead. ||||| 'Fire and Fury' breaks wait list record at the SF Public Library \n  \n Now Playing: \n  \n Interested in borrowing a copy of Michael Wolff's explosive account of the Trump administration's first few months? Get in line. \n  \n Demand for \"Fire and Fury\" has broken a record at the San Francisco Public Library, unseating the previous record-holder, Frozen, with more than 900 hold requests, according to SFPL spokeswoman Mindy Linetzky. \n  \n The book purports to detail the chaotic first months of Trump's time in office, from the president's possible senility to Ivanka Trump's reported mocking of her father's signature hairstyle (some journalists have encouraged the public to take Wolff's book with a grain of salt, while others have defended his reporting). \n  \n With interest driven by a dishy excerpt published in New York Magazine and wall-to-wall media coverage, the book was released Friday and hard copies have already amassed a 570-person waiting list at the San Francisco Public Library as of 3:30 p.m. Friday. \n  \n Looking to borrow the ebook? There are 591 people waiting for 80 copies. \n  \n And if you're more of an audiobook person, you're in for a long wait too, with 297 hold requests on 86 copies. \n  \n The library originally ordered eight copies of \"Fire and Fury,\" Linetzky said. Then the hold requests started to roll in \u2014 the first one was placed at 5:46 a.m. Wednesday. On Thursday, the library responded by ordering another 100 copies of the print edition. \n  \n \"At the end of today, for every 4 holds, we plan to buy a single EBook or EAudioBook,\" Linetzky said. \n  \n She added that the wait time for the ebook and eaudio book copies will probably be up to 12 weeks long. It's unclear how long the wait will be for print books, because the library isn't sure when the publisher will fulfill their order. \n  \n The book was initially scheduled to be published next Tuesday, but the publisher, Henry Holt & Co., moved the release up to Friday after receiving a cease and desist letter from the president's attorney. \n  \n \"We see 'Fire and Fury' as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book,\" the publisher said in a statement. \n  \n Trump, for his part, doesn't appear to be taking a cue from the old SFPL record-holder Frozen and letting it go. \n  \n \"I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!\" he tweeted Thursday. \"I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist. Look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!\" \n  \n If the library waiting list numbers are any indication, people are definitely watching. \n  \n Filipa Ioannou is an SFGATE staff writer.

Indeed, many of his tweets were the product of his repetitions \u2013 he just couldn\u2019t stop saying something.\u201d \n  \n The claims in Wolff\u2019s book have been rejected by the White House and Trump allies, but they do not exist in isolation. \n  \n Play Video 0:39 Donald Trump has 'lost it', says Michael Wolff \u2013 video \n  \n Trump\u2019s highly provocative behavior has routinely been the subject of public alarm, prompting private discussions in Washington over the potential of invoking the 25th amendment, which enables the president to be removed from office if the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet deem him physically or mentally \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\u201d. \n  \n Trump\u2019s recent tweet taunting the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un \u2013 boasting about his own \u201cmuch bigger & more powerful\u201d nuclear button \u2013 amplified concerns over the most extreme possible consequences of the president\u2019s unfiltered and largely unchecked behavior. \n  \n  \n  \n The sense of urgency surrounding Trump\u2019s mental state even led Bandy Lee, an assistant clinical professor at the Yale School of Medicine, to brief a dozen members of Congress last month on the potential risks associated with the president\u2019s behavior. \n  \n Lee, whose career has centered on studying, predicting and preventing violence, told the Guardian she and other psychiatrists were speaking out because they feel \u201cthe danger has become imminent\u201d. \n  \n Trump, she said, has already shown verbal aggressiveness, bragged about sexual assault, and incited violence at his rallies. \n  \n \u201cHe\u2019s shown an attraction to powerful weapons and war and provoked a hostile nation that already has an unstable leader and nuclear power,\u201d Lee said. \n  \n \u201cAll these signs are not just signs of dangerousness, but of the most cataclysmic kind of violence that could put an end to human life as we know it.\u201d \n  \n In October, Lee edited The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, a book consisting of essays from 27 mental health professionals assessing the president. \n  \n Two months later, she earned an audience on Capitol Hill with a group of lawmakers. The meetings, first revealed by Politico, included more than a dozen Democrats from the House of Representatives and one Republican senator. \n  \n Lee, who declined to identify any of the lawmakers by name, is also poised to meet with a Republican representative this month. Lee stressed she and others are not diagnosing the president, but rather seeking to send a message to take seriously his fitness for the Oval Office. \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the public health risk posed by him, by his mental instability,\u201d she said. \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019re not concerned about him as a person. We are concerned about his being in the office of the presidency.\u201d \n  \n Lee\u2019s public warnings have also prompted some to revisit a code of ethics instituted by the American Psychiatric Association, known as the Goldwater Rule, that prevents psychiatrists from commenting on the mental health of public figures without having examined them in person. \n  \n A recent analysis, using concerns over the psychiatric status of Trump as its premise, deemed the rule to be outdated and undermining what some psychological scientists see as a \u201cduty to inform\u201d. \n  \n Three TVs, a phone and a cheeseburger: tell-all book reveals Donald's bedtime Read more \n  \n Trump\u2019s supporters have rejected suggestions that the president is mentally unstable. \n  \n Chris Ruddy, a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s and the chief executive of the conservative Newsmax Media, said: \u201cHe is not psychologically unfit, he has not lost it.\u201d \n  \n Ruddy told CNN on Friday about time they spent together in December: \u201cHe was not repeating things. Present was a medical doctor who\u2019s a mutual friend of ours: he had no belief and view that the president was mentally incompetent and unfit. This is just an absurdity and it\u2019s really trash, actually.\u201d \n  \n The secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who has never denied privately calling Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d, has given an interview, telling CNN: \u201cI have never questioned his mental fitness. I have no reason to question his mental fitness.\u201d \n  \n The question was nonetheless posed to the White House podium, drawing a sharp rebuke from the press secretary, Sarah Sanders. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful and laughable,\u201d Sanders said. \n  \n To professionals like Lee, it is the refusal of those in Trump\u2019s orbit to acknowledge the issue that will ultimately cause the public to underestimate his fitness for the presidency. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cPeople will minimize the signs and also won\u2019t recognize it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he will grow worse.\u201d |||||\nWhat is a summary? In an exclusive interview with CNN, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that he has never questioned President Donald Trump's mental fitness and intends to remain in his position for the entire year.

    "text": "Information:  - The Canadian Prairies is a region in western Canada, which may correspond to several different definitions, natural or political. Notably, the Prairie provinces or simply the Prairies comprise the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as they are partially covered by prairie (grasslands). In a more restricted sense, the term may also refer only to the areas of those provinces covered by prairie; their portions of the physiographic region known as the Interior Plains. Prairie also covers portions of northeastern British Columbia, though that province is typically not included in the region in a political sense.  - Amegilla is a large genus of bees in the tribe Anthophorini. Several species have blue metallic bands on the abdomen, and are referred to as \"blue-banded bees\".  - The Centridini are a tribe of large apid bees, many of which possess adaptations for carrying floral oils rather than (or in addition to) pollen or nectar. The floral oils are often gathered from plants of the family Malpighiaceae, though other plants may be visited. The oil-collecting species typically have \"combs\" composed of closely spaced, flattened, blunt bristles on the margins of the first tarsal segments of the front and middle legs; others may have velvety \"pads\" to absorb the oils. They also commonly gather plant resins for use in nest cell construction. They have a tiny pterostigma in the forewing, the female scopa is very bushy, and the first flagellomere of the antenna is often longer than the scape.  - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \"Illinois\" comes from the Algonquin word for \"tribe of superior men\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.  - The bee genus Anthophora is one of the largest in the family Apidae, with over 450 species worldwide in 14 different subgenera. They are most abundant and diverse in the Holarctic and African biogeographic regions. All species are solitary, though many nest in large aggregations. Nearly all species make nests in the soil, either in banks or in flat ground; the larvae develop in cells with waterproof linings and do not spin cocoons. Males commonly have pale white or yellow facial markings, and/or peculiarly modified leg armature and hairs. \"Anthophora\" individuals can be distinguished from the very similar genus \"Amegilla\" by the possession of an arolium between the tarsal claws.  - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming.  - Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population. Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States.  - The Melectini are a tribe of medium - to large - sized apid bees found essentially worldwide. They are brood parasites of the related typical digger bees ( Anthophorini ) and occasionally visit flowers e.g. in prairie landscapes of the United States. As in other cuckoo bees, females can be easily distinguished from those of their hosts by the lack of scopae and other pollen - collecting adaptations, as well as lacking prepygidial fimbria and basitibial plates. Their body hair is rather short and on the abdomen lies flat against the exoskeleton. They may, therefore, be difficult at first glance to distinguish from the Nomadinae, but the details of their wing venation are characteristic : the marginal cell is shorter than the first two submarginal cells, and the second abscissa of vein M + Cu is extremely short, with the cells it connects being almost adjacent to each other. The jugal lobes are very small, less than half as long as the vannal lobes.  - Saskatchewan (or ) is a prairie and boreal province in west-central Canada, the only province without natural borders. It has an area of, nearly 10 percent of which is fresh water, composed mostly of rivers, reservoirs, and the province's 100,000 lakes.  - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities.  - Apidae is the largest family within the superfamily Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of bees. The family includes some of the most commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter bees, orchid bees, cuckoo bees, and a number of other less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \"\") is often said to mean \"people of the wind\" or \"people of the south wind\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - The Anthophorini are a large tribe in the subfamily Apinae of the family Apidae. Species in this tribe are often referred to as digger bees, although this common name is sometimes also applied to members of the tribe Centridini. It has over 750 species worldwide that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae; the vast majority of species are in the genera \"Amegilla\" and \"Anthophora\".  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and Le\u00f3n.  - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000\u00a0km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of. It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats.

Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay as well as the steppes of Eurasia. Lands typically referred to as \"prairie\" tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, somewhat hillier land to the east. In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and western and southern Minnesota. The Central Valley of California is also a prairie. The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.  - The Apinae are the subfamily that includes the majority of bees in the family Apidae. It includes the familiar \"corbiculate\" (pollen basket) bees  bumblebees, honey bees, orchid bees, stingless bees, and the extinct genus \"Euglossopteryx\". It also includes all but two of the groups (excluding Nomadinae and Xylocopinae) that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae.  - In geography, a plain is a flat area. Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains.  - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America.

    "text": "Please answer the following question: Information:  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Gentry (from Old French \"genterie\", from \"gentil\", \"high-born, noble\") are \"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\" of high social class, especially in the past. \"Gentry\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \"gentle\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms.  - Copenhagen (, ); ) is the capital and most populated city of Denmark. It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371. The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and is separated from Malm\u00f6, Sweden, by the strait of \u00d8resund. The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.  - Odense Steel Shipyard was a Danish shipbuilding company located in Odense. It was best known for building container ships for its parent group, A.P. Moller  Maersk Group, including the M\u00e6rsk E-class in 2006 which at the time were the biggest container ships in the world. The global financial crisis led to Maersk announcing its closure in 2009 and the last new ship was delivered in January 2012.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \"continent\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Nicolas-Henri Jardin (22 March 1720  31 August 1799), neoclassical architect, was born in St. Germain des Noyers, Dept. Seine-et-Marne, France, and worked seventeen years in Denmark as an architect to the royal court.

Its mayor is J\u00f8rn Terndrup, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council is the city of Nyborg.  - Faaborg or F\u00e5borg is an old port town located on Faaborg Fjord in Faaborg-Midtfyn municipality on the island of Funen in Denmark. By road, Faaborg is located southwest of Odense, north-northwest of Svendborg, and roughly southeast of Middelfart, depending upon the route. It has a population of 7,178 (1 January 2014). With its busy port, narrow streets and attractive old houses, the town is popular with tourists, particularly in the summer months. Faaborg was formerly the seat of Faaborg municipality. The seat of the new municipality is Ringe. Both municipalities use(d) Faaborg's medieval coat of arms.  - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry.  - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark. It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark.

He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there.  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \"practice architecture\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \"architect\" derives from the Latin \"architectus\", which derives from the Greek \" (\"arkhi-\", chief + \"tekton\", builder), i.e., chief builder.  - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\"'slack water levels',\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \"deep enough\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals.  - Arable land (from Latin \"arabilis\", \"able to be plowed\") is, according to one definition, land \"capable\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland.  - Aarhus (officially spelled \u00c5rhus from 1948 until 31 December 2010) is the second-largest city in Denmark and the seat of Aarhus municipality. It is located on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, northwest of Copenhagen and north of Hamburg, Germany. The inner urban area contains 264,716 inhabitants and the municipal population is 330,639. Aarhus is the central city in the East Jutland metropolitan area, which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of, and a population of 5.7\u00a0million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Nyborg is a city in central Denmark, located in Nyborg Municipality on the island of Funen and with a population of 16,528 (as of 1 January 2014). Nyborg is one of the 14 large municipalities created on 1 January 2007. This change boosted the population of Nyborg Municipality from around 18,000 to 31,009.  - Jutland, also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula, is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east.  - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties:  - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \"great\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \"hall\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \"great hall\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries.  - Glorup is a manor house located between Nyborg and Svendborg in the south - east of the Danish island Funen. Rebuilt to the design of Nicolas - Henri Jardin and his pupil Christian Josef Zuber in 1763 -- 65, it is considered one of the finest Baroque complexes in Denmark and was included in the 2006 Danish Culture Canon.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokm\u00e5l) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \"Norgga\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: J\u00e4mtland, H\u00e4rjedalen and Bohusl\u00e4n.  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \"The North\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the \u00c5land Islands).  - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial\u00a0 based on feudal responsibilities\u00a0 and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the \u00d6resund. At, Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of, with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \"archipelago\" is derived from the Greek \"-  arkhi-\" (\"chief\") and \"  p\u00e9lagos\" (\"sea\") through the Italian \"arcipelago\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \"*\" and Latin \"archipelagus\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - Funen, with an area of, is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Svendborg is a town on the island of Funen in south-central Denmark, and the seat of Svendborg Municipality. With a population of 26,672 (1 January 2014), Svendborg is Funen's second largest city. In 2000 Svendborg was declared \"Town of the year\" in Denmark, and in 2003 it celebrated its 750th anniversary as a market town. By road, Svendborg is located southwest of Copenhagen, south of Aarhus, south of Odense, and east of Faaborg.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \"Na Scigir\u00ed\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - Zealand is the largest (7,031\u00a0km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016).  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of, and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union.

Someone projected \u201cThis is our court\u201d onto the building\u2019s wall. Two weeks earlier, in the same square, Donald Trump had hailed Poland\u2019s role in the defence of Western values. But for the demonstrators who turned out on July 16th to protest against changes to the judicial system by the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, it was those very values that were under threat. \n  \n Since taking power in 2015, PiS has set about dismantling the country\u2019s checks and balances. It has reduced the public broadcaster to a propaganda organ, packed the civil service with loyalists and purged much of the army\u2019s leadership. It has undermined the independence of the judiciary by stacking the Constitutional Tribunal with its cronies. In response, the European Commission warned Poland\u2019s government last year that such changes pose \u201ca systemic risk to the rule of law\u201d. \n  \n Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. \n  \n On July 12th PiS stepped up its effort to subjugate the legal system to politicians\u2019 control with two new laws. Members of the National Judicial Council, the body that chooses judges, will henceforth be selected by parliament instead of by other judges. The minister of justice can now appoint and dismiss the heads of lower courts. A third bill, if signed into law, would allow the minister to sack every member of the Supreme Court. Among other responsibilities, that court rules on the validity of elections. Unexpectedly, Andrzej Duda, Poland\u2019s president, threatened to veto the bill, but with a few amendments it is now likely to pass. \n  \n Jaroslaw Kaczynski, PiS\u2019s boss and the country\u2019s de facto leader, accuses Poland\u2019s courts of being \u201csubordinated to foreign forces\u201d and beset by a \u201ccollapse of moral principles\u201d. He also calls them a \u201cstronghold of post-communists\u201d, referring to PiS\u2019s claim that Polish liberals have secret ties to the former communist regime. The reforms, he said, were needed to speed up proceedings and restore public confidence. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n In fact, Polish courts are not especially slow. Critics believe PiS simply wants to stuff them with judges who will rubber-stamp its policies. From now on, judges will owe their careers to the governing party. \u201cIt\u2019s shockingly brazen,\u201d says Kim Lane Scheppele, a sociologist at Princeton University who has analysed similar changes in Hungary. \n  \n Polls show that 76% of Poles oppose a politicised judiciary, as the protests in Warsaw and other cities attested. The front page of Dziennik Gazeta Prawna, a daily, pictured Mr Kaczynski and two shadows; the title read: \u201cThe three branches of government\u201d. Outside parliament last weekend, one man brandished a handmade placard quoting Montesquieu. Another carried a copy of the constitution. \u201cIt has no meaning now,\u201d said his wife. State television, meanwhile, described the protests as a \u201ccoup\u201d. In a rant in parliament on July 18th, Mr Kaczynski even accused the opposition of murdering his brother, who died in a plane crash in 2010. \n  \n The European Commission dutifully expressed concern over the new laws. There is some talk of imposing sanctions on Poland. But Mr Kaczynski has drawn lessons from Hungary, where Viktor Orban, the autocratic prime minister, has rewritten the constitution and tightened the screws on civil society with little trouble from the European Union. \u201cKaczynski has learned from Orban that if you change facts on the ground, the commission can\u2019t get its head around it in time,\u201d says Ms Scheppele. The EU has launched infringement procedures against Hungary, but the most serious sanctions, contained in Article 7 of the EU treaty, require a unanimous vote in the European Council. Poland would probably veto any effort to invoke them against Hungary, and vice versa. \n  \n Yet unlike Hungary, where Mr Orban\u2019s party enjoys a crushing majority, Poland is politically divided. PiS won just 37.5% of the vote in 2015. Civil society remains strong, and the government responds to public pressure: last year it backed down from a strict abortion law when faced with massive protests. The independence of Poland\u2019s judiciary may depend on how strongly Poles want to keep it. ||||| WARSAW \u2014 Step by step, the Polish government has moved against democratic norms: It increased government control over the news media, cracked down on public gatherings and restricted the activities of nongovernmental organizations. \n  \n Now the party in power is moving aggressively to take control of the last major independent government institution, the courts, drawing crowds into the streets and possible condemnation by the European Union. \n  \n The party is pushing to jam several bills into law; one would force all the nation\u2019s top judges to resign, except those it appointed. Another bill, already approved by Parliament, would ultimately give the government control over who can even be considered for a judgeship. \n  \n In Brussels on Wednesday, a top European Union official said that if the changes were made, Poland might slip outside the bloc\u2019s definition of a democracy. ||||| Leader of the ruling Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski votes to approve a law on court control, in the parliament in Warsaw, Poland, Thursday, July 20, 2017. The bill on the Supreme Court has... (Associated Press) \n  \n WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Warsaw and towns across Poland on Thursday night to protest the ruling party's drive to reorganize all levels of the judiciary, including contentious legislation that gives control of the nation's Supreme Court to the president instead of to judges. \n  \n Poland's prime minister appeared on national television to defend the changes as opponents of her government urged the president to reject the changes. \n  \n Opposition lawmakers and celebrities joined the crowd in front of the Presidential Palace in Warsaw as protesters held up candles, waved national and European Union flags and chanted \"free courts\" and \"democracy.\" \n  \n Warsaw police spokesman Mariusz Mrozek said some 14,000 participated, while city hall estimated the crowd at 50,000. \n  \n The crowd later moved to the parliament building where a Senate commission was debating the Supreme Court law, ahead of Senate's Friday session. \n  \n Critics say the Supreme Court legislation and two earlier bills destroy judicial independence and threaten democracy. \n  \n In her nationwide speech, Beata Szydlo said that the legislation was prompted by public criticism of the legal system's inefficiency and blamed the outcry it has triggered on the opposition's \"frustration.\" \n  \n Szydlo insisted the government will not bow to pressure \"from Polish or from foreign defenders of the interest of the elites.\" \n  \n Her comments appeared to refer to warnings from the European Union of sanctions against Poland, including the possibility of stripping Warsaw of its EU voting rights. \n  \n Szydlo spoke after lawmakers voted to approve the contentious Supreme Court legislation. Critics concede that the judiciary needs reform, but that the proposed changes are going in the wrong direction. \n  \n The bill also calls for the dismissal of the court's current judges, except for those chosen by the president. It rearranges the court's structure and adds a Disciplinary Chamber that would handle breaches of rules or ethics in the justice system. \n  \n European Union president, Donald Tusk, Poland's former prime minister, has appealed to President Andrzej Duda for a meeting to seek ways out of the situation that, he said, goes against EU values and is destructive to Poland's international image. \n  \n The bill still needs approval from the Senate, which is expected to be granted at a session Friday, and from Duda, a lawyer, who has so far followed the ruling party line. \n  \n Earlier Thursday, a small group of protesters kicked metal barriers that separated them from the parliament, chanting \"Shame!\" to express their anger at the lawmakers. \n  \n The new law is part of the ruling party's drive to reorganize all levels of Poland's judiciary. The party leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, also a lawyer, insists the justice system needs radical reform because, he says, it still works along communist-era lines \u2014 a claim judges dispute. \n  \n Party spokeswoman, Beata Mazurek, said Thursday that people in small towns across the country have a sense the justice system is not on their side and the party wants to change that. \n  \n \"We are taking Poland in the right direction,\" Mazurek said. \n  \n But not all agree. \n  \n Supreme Court chief Malgorzata Gersdorf says, on average, the court takes seven months to rule on a case \u2014 but she calls that a good result, even by European standards, given that the court handles the most difficult and complicated matters. \n  \n Opposition lawmaker and former justice minister Borys Budka says the bill makes the judges dependent on one party and denies citizens the right to independent courts. He also condemned the speed with which the bill was passed, saying it was done without proper public consultation. ||||| A furious Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski lashed out at the opposition in parliament | Bartomiej Zborowski/EPA Polish president bucks ruling party over judicial reforms During a bad-tempered debate, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski accuses the opposition of \u2018murdering\u2019 his brother. \n  \n In a rare display of political defiance, Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday bucked his political patron Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski by moving to slow an effort to bring the judiciary under government control. \n  \n The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has been pushing through legislation that dramatically changes Poland\u2019s legal order \u2014 raising concerns from the EU and human rights organizations, and sparking anti-government demonstrations over the weekend. \n  \n Last week, parliament adopted a new law revamping the body that appoints judges, the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), ending the terms of its 15 judges and allowing parliament, where PiS has a narrow majority, to nominate their successors. \n  \n The ruling party then moved on to legislation that would immediately retire all the judges on the Supreme Court except those designated by Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, and would lower the requirements for future judges chosen for the court \u2014 a step critics say would allow the ruling party to pack the court with its allies. The Supreme Court is Poland\u2019s top court for civil, criminal and military cases; it also confirms election results. \n  \n PiS says the court system is slow, corrupt and inefficient. \n  \n All of the legislation has to be approved by Duda, a former Law and Justice MEP chosen by Kaczy\u0144ski to run for president in 2015. He has been leery of vetoing legislation backed by PiS, and has strongly identified with the party\u2019s program despite the Polish tradition of presidents being non-partisan. \n  \n Duda stepped into the polarized debate over the judicial reforms on Tuesday, saying he had submitted his own legislation regulating the KRS. Under his version, new judges would have to be chosen by a three-fifths majority in parliament \u2014 and Law and Justice falls short of that on its own. \n  \n If parliament does not pass his bill, Duda said he would veto legislation on the Supreme Court. \n  \n \u201cThis project is aimed at preventing the assertion that the KRS is controlled by only one grouping, that it acts under political dictate,\u201d Duda said. \n  \n However, Duda made clear he supports PiS\u2019 broader aim of reforming the judiciary. \u201cI agree that reform of the KRS is needed, and with the essential direction of that reform. I\u2019m also convinced that the [Supreme Court] needs reform.\u201d \n  \n Beata Mazurek, a PiS spokeswoman, said parliament won\u2019t consider Duda\u2019s bill unless he first signs last week\u2019s legislation on the KRS into law. \n  \n Duda\u2019s intervention came during a stormy debate in parliament over the Supreme Court reform bill. Police surrounded the building as protesters gathered outside. The debate resumed Wednesday morning. \n  \n Late Tuesday, a furious Kaczy\u0144ski lashed out at the opposition after MPs said that his dead twin brother, former President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, would have opposed the new judicial laws. Kaczy\u0144ski stormed to the podium of the parliament and accused the opposition of being responsible for the 2010 airplane crash that killed his brother. \n  \n \u201cDo not wipe your treacherous mugs with the name of my late brother. You were destroying him, you murdered him, you are scum,\u201d he shouted. \n  \n Grzegorz Schetyna, leader of Civic Platform, the largest opposition party, greeted Duda\u2019s unexpected intervention with \u201crelief.\u201d \n  \n \u201cThis is a good move in a good direction,\u201d he told reporters. \n  \n The opposition accuses Law and Justice and Kaczy\u0144ski, Poland\u2019s most powerful politician, of subverting the constitution by eroding the independence of the judiciary. \n  \n Ma\u0142gorzata Gersdorf, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, addressed parliament earlier Tuesday, saying there was no reason to eliminate the court. \n  \n \u201cAt the moment the bill says that the minister of justice, in other words a part of the executive branch, controls everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no basis for this in the constitution.\u201d \n  \n PiS says the court system is slow, corrupt and inefficient. Kaczy\u0144ski has called judicial reform \u201cabsolutely fundamental.\u201d His accusation is that 27 years after the end of communism, the courts are still under the control of communists and their heirs. The average age of a Polish judge is 38. \n  \n \u201cThe courts have essentially stayed the same as in communist Poland,\u201d he told a rally of the ruling party earlier this month. \n  \n Kaczy\u0144ski has long been a foe of the court system, which blocked some of his initiatives during Law and Justice\u2019s previous government, which ruled from 2005-2007. \n  \n Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s view is that the parliamentary majority his party won in 2015 gives it the right to rule the country, without other institutions like the courts blocking the government. In a recent interview, he said he wants to \u201creturn the courts to the nation and return the functioning of a democratic electoral system over the courts.\u201d \n  \n The effort to bring the judicial system under political control has sparked strong opposition in Poland. On Sunday thousands of people rallied outside the Supreme Court, surrounding its headquarters with candles. \n  \n However, the opposition parties are fragmented and have been unable to find a leader who appeals to the country at large. Opinion polls show that PiS still has the support of about a third of the electorate, far ahead of the opposition. \n  \n If Duda\u2019s initiative passes, it would make it more difficult but not impossible for the ruling party to control the KRS. PiS has 234 seats in the 460-seat parliament, so falls short of the 276 votes needed if Duda\u2019s bill is approved. However, if one populist party and independent MPs support PiS, it could marshal 277 votes. \n  \n The Polish government\u2019s efforts are alarming Brussels. Earlier efforts to defend the Constitutional Tribunal, a court that rules on whether legislation is constitutional, failed and PiS now controls that body. The Supreme Court was due to consider in September whether the restructuring of the tribunal was legal. \n  \n The Commission is due to discuss the situation in Poland on Wednesday. \n  \n Micha\u0142 Broniatowski in Warsaw contributed to this article. \n  \n This article has been updated with Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s speech in parliament. ||||| The EU is on the brink of taking the nuclear option of stripping Poland of its voting rights in Brussels in response to plans by its rightwing government to \u201cabolish\u201d the independence of the country\u2019s judiciary. \n  \n  \n  \n Frans Timmermans, the first vice-president of the European commission, accused Warsaw of seeking to put judges under full political control as he warned that the EU was \u201cvery close\u201d to triggering article 7, a never-before-used sanction in the treaties that allows a member state\u2019s voting rights in the council of ministers to be suspended. \n  \n Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS) has been in almost constant conflict with the European commission since it was elected. In recent weeks the Polish government has proposed a series of reforms that would give ministers power over the appointment of judges and members of the country\u2019s supreme court. \n  \n The first step in the EU triggering article 7 is an assessment of whether there has been a breach of fundamental rights, which could be launched as early as next week on the recommendation of the commission. \u201cWhat we decide next week depends on developments also this week,\u201d Timmermans said, as he called for fresh dialogue with Warsaw. \n  \n The Guardian view on Poland and Hungary: heading the wrong way | Editorial Read more \n  \n Should a breach of fundamental rights be found, a motion to suspend Poland\u2019s voting rights would then need to win the support of member states under the EU\u2019s system of qualified majority voting. Two-thirds of the European parliament would also need to give its consent. \n  \n Timmermans told reporters in Brussels that the recent proposal from the Polish government to increase political control of the judiciary was a grave threat to the fundamental values of the EU. \n  \n \u201cThese laws considerably increase the systemic threat to the rule of law in Poland. Each individual law, if adopted, would seriously erode the independence of the Polish judiciary. Collectively they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government. \n  \n Q&A Why does the Polish government want to appoint judges? Show Hide The attempt by Poland's Law and Justice party to take control of the judicial system should be seen as part of a wider campaign to dismantle democratic checks and balances on the government\u2019s actions, from its takeover of state media to its capture of the country\u2019s constitutional tribunal. \n  \n Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, PiS\u2019s leader, has developed a theory known in Poland as \ufffd?impossibilism\u2019, the idea that no serious reform of Polish society and institutions is possible due to these checks and balances, and what he describes as the vested interests of liberal elites and foreigners intent on exploiting the country. \n  \n \u201cUnder these reforms judges will serve at the pleasure of political leaders, and be dependent upon them, from their appointment to their pension.\u201d \n  \n The commissioner added: \u201cI think every citizen wants to have, if they need to, a day in court without having to say, \ufffd?Hmm, is this judge going to get a call from a minister telling him what to do?\u2019.\u201d \n  \n Timmermans said he was confident he would have the support of member states should he recommend the triggering of article 7. \n  \n In Warsaw, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, an MP with the opposition Civic Platform party and a former Europe minister, said Poland was being pushed to the margins of the EU by its authoritarian government. \n  \n He said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear that patience is running out, not only in the European commission, but also in many European capitals. \n  \n \u201cThe initiation of article 7 would be unprecedented, and it would show quite clearly how marginalised the current government is in the European Union.\u201d \n  \n Timmermans, a former Dutch minister who has been the subject of personal attacks by Polish ministers over his tough stance with Poland in recent months, said he had written earlier this month to Warsaw about his concerns, but appeals for the proposed laws not to be pursued had been ignored. Two of the four pieces of legislation in question have since been adopted by parliament. \n  \n Timmermans said any concerns that triggering article 7 would push Poland to follow the UK out of the union would not be an obstacle to the EU taking action.",

A key test will be next week when he appears on stage with his rivals at the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado. \n  \n Appearing at a forum on Friday at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Bush was asked by moderator Pat Robertson whether the cost-cutting was aimed at making his campaign leaner \"or does this mean you're in trouble?\" \n  \n \"This means lean and mean and means that I have the ability to adapt,\" Bush said. \"I have not met a person who thought Donald Trump would be the front-running candidate at this point. God bless him for his success in that regard. We'll see how long it lasts. But you have to adapt.\" \n  \n In a poll of likely Iowa Republican caucus participants released on Thursday by Quinnipiac University, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson led the Republican field with 28 percent support, followed by Trump at 20 percent. Bush was tied in sixth place with former business executive Carly Fiorina with 5 percent. \n  \n Bush's move to reduce expenses comes a month after the departure from the race of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who ran out of cash. \n  \n \"If you do the right thing about budget cuts at the right time, they don't necessarily affect your chances,\" said Republican strategist Charlie Black, citing the examples of Ronald Reagan in 1979 and John McCain in 2007. \n  \n DONOR RETREAT THIS WEEKEND \n  \n Bush's heavy policy focus has shown him to be among the more serious candidates in the Republican field, but he has often been drowned out by Trump's bombastic rhetoric and has lacked the polished communication skills of rivals such as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. \n  \n Bush announced last week that his third-quarter fund-raising was $13.4 million, a competitive sum but not enough to finance the large campaign operation he had built. As of last week he had $10 million in cash on hand. \n  \n \"It's no secret that the contours of this race have changed from what was anticipated at the start,\" the memo said. \n  \n The Bush campaign also sought to reassure donors who have started to doubt that their candidate still has a path to the nomination. \n  \n Bush and his senior aides are staging a two-day donor retreat in Houston on Sunday and Monday that will feature appearances by his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and his brother former President George W. Bush. \n  \n The retreat will give donors a sense of where the campaign stands now and what is planned for the next 100 days, an aide said. \n  \n The staff deployments from Miami will have a special focus on increasing the Bush presence in New Hampshire. Bush will make more trips to the early voting states as well. \n  \n \"We are unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome,\" the memo said. \n  \n The cost-cutting moves were welcome in the Bush donor community, where there have been concerns about his prospects. \n  \n \"I particularly appreciate that this strategy shift was quick, strategic and bold. As a donor, I am thrilled to see the campaign focus the lion's share of resources on voter contact and this will redirect energy to early states,\" said Slater Bayliss, a Florida lobbyist who is bundling donations for Bush. \n  \n (Additional reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Paul Simao and Frances Kerry) ||||| Jeb Bush, once a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is slashing pay across the board for his struggling campaign as he attempts to regain traction just 100 days before the party\u2019s first nominating contest. \n  \n The campaign is removing some senior staff from the payroll, parting ways with some consultants, and downsizing its Miami headquarters to save more than $1 million per month and cut payroll by 40 percent this week, according to Bush campaign officials who requested anonymity to speak about internal changes. Senior leadership positions remain unchanged. \n  \n The campaign is also cutting back 45 percent of its budget, except for dollars earmarked for TV advertising and spending for voter contacts, such as phone calls and mailers. Some senior-level staff and consultants will continue to work with the campaign on a volunteer basis, while other junior-level consultants, primarily in finance but including other areas, will be let go, the officials said. The officials declined to say who would be removed from the payroll or provide an exact dollar figure for the savings. (A summary of the changes, provided to Bloomberg Politics by the campaign, is posted here.) \n  \n Bush's advisers, under pressure from their donors and from falling and stagnant poll numbers, have been discussing ways to retool the campaign in recent days, and came to the conclusion that a course correction was essential. While recent tangles with Donald Trump have energized the campaign, Bush's senior team recognized a more fundamental set of changes was required that didn't involve dealing directly with the party's surprising\u2014and surprisingly durable\u2014front-runner. \n  \n \"The circumstances when we started the election were different,\" Bush told Pat Robertson in an interview at Regent University hours after news of the shakeup broke. \"I have not met a person that thought that Donald Trump would be the front running candidate at this point. God bless him for his success in that regard, we\u2019ll see how long that lasts. But you have to adapt.\u201d He said his new \"lean and mean\" campaign will allow him to do that. \"Every dollar we can save in overhead is a dollar that goes on television, goes on radio, goes on media, goes on voter outreach,\" Bush added. \n  \n Analysts and rival campaigns will view the changes as a desperate act, perhaps the last one, of a man whose campaign has dropped in the polls in recent months and has remained mired in the middle of a crowded field despite a month-long blitz of friendly television ads. None of the changes deal directly with what even many of Bush's supporters say is his main challenge: The burden of trying to convince voters hungry for change to choose a man whose father and brother both served as president. \n  \n Officials said the changes\u2014the second time the campaign has cuts its payroll this year\u2014will enable them to shift more resources into New Hampshire, where the campaign has the largest operation in the state, and other states where early voters begin casting ballots in February. There will be more volunteers and surrogates for Bush, which the campaign refers to as \u201cfriends of Jeb,\u201d on the ground to help in a state that his brother lost in 2000 and his father won in 1988. \n  \n One Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics in an interview Friday morning that the team was \u201cunapologetic\u201d about the changes, saying the moves were from a \u201cposition of strength.\u201d \u201cThis is about winning the race,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.\u201d \n  \n Bush plans to continue to focus on a core message that argues that he has experience to make the kinds of fundamental changes voters want to see in Washington. The campaign changes reflect that, an adviser said. \n  \n Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. \n  \n The campaign claims to have the most extensive field operation in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, states with the first four nominating contests. Bush had $10.3 million available for the primary race as of Oct. 1, about the same as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, but less than U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Dr. Ben Carson. Right to Rise USA, the super-PAC being run by Mike Murphy, raised $103 million in the first six months of the year. \n  \n Still, many thought Bush would keep the pole position heading into the 2016 primary calendar. But the former Florida governor and his advisers had little choice but to make the changes to redirect resources and attempt to create a new narrative for the campaign before the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa and\u2014more importantly for Bush\u2014the Feb. 9 primary in New Hampshire. \n  \n In a presidential campaign cycle that has already seen stunning twists and turns, to see the presumed establishment front-runner, whose strength was based in part on his fundraising capacity, have to make these kinds of cuts, is one of the most surprising developments so far. \n  \n One of Bush's rivals, Carson, who leads in a new Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa Poll, was taken aback in an interview Friday morning that Bush is being forced to make some changes. \n  \n \u201cThis is a little bit surprising, but you know a lot of his money, of course, was super-PAC money as opposed to campaign money,\u201d Carson said in an interview that will air on With All Due Respect today on Bloomberg TV. \u201cThat doesn't give you as much flexibility, quite frankly.\u201d \n  \n The campaign said its internal measures showed that the month-long run of TV advertising is having an impact. \u201cWe need to double down and triple down in the early states,\u201d another Bush official said. \n  \n Bush, who aides said was actively involved in the decision to cut back, will spend less time raising money and more time engaged in retail political events, such as town halls, meet-and-greets, and one-on-one meetings, advisers said. \n  \n Although Bush's long-time political adviser, Murphy, who now runs the pro-Bush super-PAC backing his candidacy, told Bloomberg Politics recently that Bush's strength in the March contests would earn him the nomination, the changes are an acknowledgement that Bush needs to first improve his standing in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. \n  \n Symbolically, the changes turn Bush from an establishment battleship into a more scrappy underdog, making radical alterations in how the campaign operates in order to avoid the existential threat the campaign now faces. When his brother George W. Bush ran for president in 2000, he was the fundraising leader from start to finish and never had to contemplate such draconian cuts. \n  \n The changes come a week after Danny Diaz, Bush\u2019s campaign manager, sought to ease concerns about the amount of cash being spent by pointing to campaign\u2019s robust operation in states with the earliest primary contests. \n  \n Polls from Bloomberg Politics this week showed Bush in fifth place in Iowa and a distant third in New Hampshire. \n  \n (Contributing: Arit John) |||||  \n  \n (Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun via AP) \n  \n Jeb Bush is shaking up his struggling presidential campaign, ordering across-the-board pay cuts, downsizing his headquarters staff, cutting ties with some consultants and refocusing his efforts on retail campaigning and on-the-ground organizing in the early voting states. \n  \n Bush's major course correction, first reported Friday by Bloomberg Politics, comes as the onetime front-runner languishes in the single digits in polls and struggles to catch on with Republican voters. The former Florida governor's fundraising slowed over the summer, and his donors and other supporters have grown concerned about his standing in the race. \n  \n In a statement Friday morning announcing the moves, campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said, \"We are making changes today to ensure Jeb is best positioned to win the nomination and general election. Jeb is the one candidate with a proven conservative record, bold ideas and the strong leadership needed to fix the problems America faces. We are moving our resources into the states to ensure that voters in primary and caucus states are introduced to his record and vision for the future.\" \n  \n The campaign, which entered October with $10.3 million in the bank, is taking significant steps to curtail spending. It is slashing its budget, excluding media and voter contact efforts, by 45 percent from its June plans, and is reducing ties to some consultants to eliminate what the campaign sees as extraneous overhead costs. \n  \n The campaign also is reducing payroll by 40 percent, including salary cuts for every employee save the most entry-level staffers. Only 25 percent of the staff will remain at the Miami headquarters, with another 25 percent already in early voting states, and the majority of remaining staff offered positions in the states or as part of a ballot access team at a reduced wage. \n  \n The campaign also will cut travel expenses by 20 percent and overhaul Bush's schedule, shifting focus from fundraising events to make space on the candidate's calendar for more town hall meetings and other retail campaign stops in the early voting states. \n  \n In a two-page memorandum outlining talking points for supporters, the Bush campaign cast the changes as \"deft\" moves to position Bush for the long haul. The campaign is doubling down on its organizing efforts in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, as well as its investments in data and digital programs. \n  \n The campaign is placing what it calls \"a special focus\" on its New Hampshire operation, which already includes 12 paid staffers. The Bush team has long eyed the Granite State's primary as his best opportunity for an early victory. \n  \n \"We are in this campaign to win,\" read the memorandum. \"We will take every single step necessary to ensure Jeb is the Republican nominee and next President of the United States. We are unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome.\" \n  \n Bush plans to adjust his message on the campaign trail to better woo voters, according to the memorandum. The campaign will deliver several direct pitches to voters, including \"Jeb Can Fix It,\" arguing that after President Obama's two terms Bush is the only candidate in the 2016 field who can \"fix\" what he sees as broken in Washington. Bush also will make an \"experience vs. experiment\" argument, comparing his Florida record to his opponents who have less experience in government or who \"cannot be trusted.\" \n  \n Bush has been considered the fundraising leader of the Republican field in large part because of the $103 million he raised in the first six months of this year for his allied super PAC, Right to Rise, which can accept unlimited donations. \n  \n But Bush has had a harder time raising money for his official campaign, for which donations are capped under federal law at $2,700 per person. The campaign raised $13.4 million in July, August and September \u2014 a solid haul, but not enough to maintain the kind of national campaign infrastructure he had been building in Miami and the early voting states. \n  \n Bush has raised just 5 percent of his primary money from donors who gave him $200 or less so far this year, for a total of $1.2 million in all. Even former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee beat him in small donations, collecting $1.3 million so far, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. \n  \n Such a tiny base of grass-roots support can be perilous for a campaign, which needs to be able to rely on a constant infusion of cash as it expands. \n  \n This is the second round of belt-tightening in Bush's campaign. In August, some top aides had their salaries shaved, and there were other targeted cutbacks to create a more lean operation, as The New York Times first reported, though Friday's announcement is far more sweeping. \n  \n Two people familiar with the campaign said they were not surprised by the news. \"This necessary tightening has been in the works for a while,\" said one, who, along with his colleague, asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the changes. The extent of the cuts, hefty for some senior staffers, became evident in the last few days through conversations with campaign advisers grumbling about the cuts. \n  \n The announcement comes ahead of a quarterly strategy summit with major supporters in Houston this weekend, where top donors will hear updates from senior campaign officials and visit with members of the Bush family, including former president George H.W. Bush and former president George W. Bush. \n  \n Matea Gold and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report. ||||| Message Points: Campaign Update \n  \n Top Line Message Points: \n  \n  \n  \n \u2022 Jeb is in this race for the long haul.

We \n  \n would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting \n  \n Canadian-\u00ad\u2010style single-\u00ad\u2010payer health care and partial-\u00ad\u2010birth abortion would be leading the GOP Primary. \n  \n \u2022 \n  \n Ensuring we are in the most competitive position possible in this unpredictable field requires we \n  \n remain as deft as possible, making strategic decisions quickly and intelligently. \n  \n \u2022 \n  \n We are in this campaign to win. We will take every single step necessary to ensure Jeb is the \n  \n Republican nominee and next President of the United States. We are unapologetic about adjusting our \n  \n game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome. \n  \n \u2022 \n  \n In order to achieve this end, the campaign is making aggressive changes to our campaign structure, \n  \n putting as much money as possible into voter contact, and winning primaries and caucuses. \n  \n  \n  \n Campaign Structure: \n  \n  \n  \n \u2022 Over the last four months, our team has consistently reviewed our budget and made spending \n  \n reductions, including: budget cuts by department and salary reductions to senior and mid-\u00ad\u2010level \n  \n staffers. \n  \n  \n  \n \u2022 \n  \n Today, we are expanding those reductions in order to maximize our resources where they matter \n  \n most: voter contact and personnel in the early states to ensure we can be successful in the primaries \n  \n and caucuses. \n  \n \u2022 \n  \n To achieve that objectives we are making the following changes: \n  \n o Reducing payroll costs by 40% this week; \n  \n o Cutting salaries across the board, with all but the most entry level staff taking cuts; \n  \n o Downsizing our headquarters staff: 25% is remaining in headquarters, 25% of our staff is already in \n  \n the states; the vast majority of the remaining staff is being offered a position in the early states or \n  \n as part of our ballot access efforts at a reduced salary; \n  \n o Cutting travel costs by 20%; \n  \n o Eliminating other extraneous overhead costs entirely, cutting 45% of our non media/voter contact \n  \n budget from our original June planning. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \u2022 \n  \n \u2022 \n  \n We continue to have a strong national finance operation that will ensure Jeb remains competitive by \n  \n every measure, through the primary and onto victory next November. Just last week announced that \n  \n we had raised more than $13",
